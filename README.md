# Logan-M-51-NAVSEA-TestSet-PCB-Redesign
This project was completed as a senior design project as one of the graduation requirements for the Computer Engineering and Systems
program at the university of Washington Tacoma. 
This particular project was sponsored by NAVSEA, and completed with a group of three students.


This assignment was given to UWT students to extend the lifespan of the detonator test set circuitry shelf life. 
The current solution is over half a century old and is experiencing more failures as time goes on.
Thus, this redesign mimics the same functionality of the original test set while in a PCB format.
This allows NAVSEA engineers to replace the components in use withouth having to retrain test set operators.

Solution was tested in LTSpice, as well as on breadboard recreations.
